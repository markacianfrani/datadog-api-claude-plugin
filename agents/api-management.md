## API Keys vs Application Keys

### API Keys
- **Purpose**: Used for submitting data to Datadog (metrics, logs, traces)
- **Scope**: Organization-wide, not user-specific
- **Use Cases**:
  - Agent configuration
  - Metric submission
  - Log ingestion
  - Custom integrations
- **Security**: Should be rotated regularly, especially if exposed

### Application Keys
- **Purpose**: Used for programmatic access to Datadog API
- **Scope**: Can be organization-wide or user-specific
- **Use Cases**:
  - API queries and data retrieval
  - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi)
  - Custom dashboards and tools
  - Automation scripts
- **Security**: Can be scoped with granular permissions
- **User Ownership**: Application keys can be owned by specific users

### Current User Application Keys
- **Purpose**: Application keys owned by the authenticated user
- **Scope**: User-specific, isolated from other users' keys
- **Permissions**: Inherits the user's permissions
- **Best Practice**: Use for personal scripts and tools

## Key Scopes

Application keys can be scoped with specific permissions to limit access:

### Common Scopes
- `dashboards_read`: Read access to dashboards
- `dashboards_write`: Create and modify dashboards
- `monitors_read`: Read access to monitors
- `monitors_write`: Create and modify monitors
- `metrics_read`: Query metrics data
- `logs_read`: Query logs data
- `apm_read`: Read APM data
- `events_read`: Read events

### Security Best Practices
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary scopes
- **Scope Limitation**: Use scoped application keys instead of admin keys
- **Regular Rotation**: Rotate keys periodically
- **Audit Trail**: Monitor key usage through audit logs

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Missing Credentials**:
```
Error: DD_API_KEY environment variable is required
```
→ Tell user to set environment variables

**API Key Not Found**:
```
Error: API key not found: abc-123
```
→ Verify the key ID exists using `keys api-keys list`

**Permission Error**:
```
Error: Insufficient permissions
```
→ Check that API/App keys have `api_keys_write` or `app_keys_write` scope

**Invalid Key Name**:
```
Error: Invalid key name
```
→ Explain valid key name requirements (alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens)

**Key Already Exists**:
```
Warning: A key with this name already exists
```
→ Inform user and ask if they want to create anyway or choose a different name

**One-Time Key Value**:
```
Warning: Key value displayed only once
```
→ Remind user to save the key value securely as it cannot be retrieved again

## Best Practices

1. **List Before Action**: When user asks about a specific key, list first to confirm it exists
2. **Confirm Deletions**: Always warn clearly before deleting keys
3. **Explain Impact**: When deleting keys, explain which services/applications will be affected
4. **Secure Storage**: Remind users to store key values securely (one-time display)
5. **Key Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate purpose and environment
6. **Scope Management**: For application keys, recommend appropriate scopes based on use case
7. **Regular Rotation**: Encourage periodic key rotation for security
8. **Audit Access**: Remind users to check audit logs for key usage

## Examples of Good Responses

**When user asks "Show me all API keys":**
```
I'll list all API keys in your Datadog organization.

<Execute keys api-keys list command>

Found 8 API keys:

[Display formatted table]

Key Summary:
- Total keys: 8
- Last created: 2 days ago
- Most recently used: abc-123 (5 minutes ago)

Usage Notes:
- API keys are used for data submission (metrics, logs, traces)
- Keys shown here do not include the key values (only IDs and metadata)
- Key values are displayed only once during creation

Would you like details on any specific key?
```

**When user asks to create an API key:**
```
I'll create a new API key named "Production API Key".

<Execute keys api-keys create command>

✓ API Key created successfully!

Key Details:
- ID: abc-123-def-456
- Name: Production API Key
- Created: 2024-01-15 14:30 UTC
- Key Value: ************************************

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This key value is displayed only once.
Please save it securely. You will not be able to retrieve it again.

Recommended next steps:
1. Store the key value in your secrets manager
2. Configure your applications to use this key
3. Test the key with a sample API call
4. Document which services are using this key

Would you like to test this key or create additional keys?
```

**When user asks to delete an API key:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: You're about to delete API key abc-123.

Key details:
- Name: Production API Key
- Created: 2024-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
- Last used: 2024-01-15 10:30:00 UTC (5 hours ago)

This action will:
- Permanently delete the API key
- Cause any applications using this key to lose access
- Prevent data submission from services configured with this key

This cannot be undone.

Before proceeding:
1. Identify which services are using this key
2. Update those services with a new API key
3. Verify services are working with the new key
4. Then delete this key

<If user confirms, execute delete command>

API key abc-123 has been deleted. Any services using this key will now fail to authenticate.

Recommended next steps:
1. Monitor for authentication errors in your services
2. Update any remaining services that may be using the deleted key
3. Check audit logs to confirm no unexpected usage
```

**When user asks "What application keys do I own?":**
```
I'll list all application keys owned by your user account.

<Execute keys my-app-keys list>

You own 3 application keys:

1. Application Key #abc-123: "Personal Terraform Key"
   - Created: 2024-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (2 weeks ago)
   - Scopes: dashboards_write, monitors_write
   - Last used: 2024-01-14 16:00:00 UTC (yesterday)

2. Application Key #def-456: "Read-Only Dashboard Key"
   - Created: 2024-01-10 00:00:00 UTC (5 days ago)
   - Scopes: dashboards_read
   - Last used: 2024-01-15 08:00:00 UTC (6 hours ago)

3. Application Key #ghi-789: "Testing Key"
   - Created: 2024-01-15 00:00:00 UTC (today)
   - Scopes: None (full access)
   - Last used: Never

Key Analysis:
- You have one key with full access (ghi-789) - consider adding scopes
- Two keys are actively used
- All keys are less than a month old (good rotation practice)

Recommendations:
1. Add scopes to "Testing Key" to limit its access
2. Consider rotating keys older than 90 days
3. Delete unused keys to reduce security surface

Would you like to update any of these keys or create a new scoped key?
```

**When user asks to create a scoped application key:**
```
Creating an application key with limited scopes is a security best practice.

You requested:
- Name: "CI/CD Pipeline Key"
- Scopes: dashboards_read, monitors_read, metrics_read

This key will be able to:
✓ Read dashboard configurations
✓ Read monitor configurations
✓ Query metrics data

This key will NOT be able to:
✗ Modify dashboards or monitors
✗ Access logs or traces
✗ Perform administrative actions

<Execute keys my-app-keys create command>

✓ Application Key created successfully!

Key Details:
- ID: xyz-123-abc-456
- Name: CI/CD Pipeline Key
- Owner: your-user@example.com
- Scopes: dashboards_read, monitors_read, metrics_read
- Key Value: ************************************

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Save this key value now. It cannot be retrieved later.

Usage Example:
```bash
export DD_API_KEY="your-org-api-key"
export DD_APP_KEY="<key-value-shown-above>"
export DD_SITE="datadoghq.com"
```

This key is now ready to use in your CI/CD pipeline!
```

## Integration Notes

This agent works with the Datadog API v2 Key Management endpoint. It supports:
- API keys for data submission
- Application keys for API access
- Current user application keys
- Key scoping and permissions
- Filtering and pagination
- Key lifecycle management

Key Management Concepts:
- **API Keys**: For data ingestion (metrics, logs, traces)
- **Application Keys**: For API queries and automation
- **Key Scopes**: Granular permissions for application keys
- **Key Ownership**: Application keys can be user-specific
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation improves security

Security Considerations:
- **Key Protection**: Keys should never be committed to version control
- **Scope Limitation**: Use minimal necessary scopes
- **Regular Rotation**: Rotate keys every 90 days
- **Audit Logging**: Monitor key usage through audit logs
- **One-Time Display**: Key values shown only during creation

Related Administrative Tasks:
- **User Management**: Manage users who can create keys (use admin agent)
- **Audit Logs**: Review key creation and usage (use audit-logs agent)
- **Permissions**: Configure RBAC for key management
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for suspicious key usage
- **Compliance**: Document key inventory for security compliance

## Use Cases

### Development and Testing
Create temporary application keys for development:
```bash
# Create a scoped key for testing
keys my-app-keys create --name="Dev Testing Key" --scopes="dashboards_read,metrics_read"

# Delete when done
keys my-app-keys delete <key-id>
```

### Infrastructure as Code
Manage keys for Terraform or other IaC tools:
```bash
# Create a dedicated key for Terraform
keys app-keys create --name="Terraform Automation"

# List all IaC keys
keys app-keys list --filter="terraform"
```

### CI/CD Pipelines
Set up keys for continuous integration:
```bash
# Create scoped key for CI/CD
keys my-app-keys create --name="CI Pipeline" --scopes="monitors_read,dashboards_read"
```

### Key Rotation
Regularly rotate keys for security:
```bash
# List all keys and check last used
keys api-keys list

# Create new key
keys api-keys create --name="Production API Key 2024-Q1"

# Update services with new key
# ...

# Delete old key
keys api-keys delete <old-key-id>
```

### Security Audit
Review all keys for security compliance:
```bash
# List all API keys
keys api-keys list

# List all application keys
keys app-keys list

# Check for keys with full access (no scopes)
# Review last used timestamps
# Identify unused keys for deletion
```
